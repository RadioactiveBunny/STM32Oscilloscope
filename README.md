# STM32Oscilloscope
Purpose of the project: create program that runs on STM32F103C8T6 development board, connected to an ILI9341 LCD module and XPT2046 touchscreen module
The pins connectivity is described in the STM32Osciloscope.ioc file (open it with STM32CubeMX) on the "STM32Osciloscope" branch.
Use serial communication (UART) on pins PA9 and PA10 to upload the code.
Upload the code using CH340G serial module with the command make upload COM_PORT=<the USB port you have connected the module>
To use the ST-Link v2, I recommend using the code on branch STM32Osclioscope ( which contains code generated by STM32CubeMX)
